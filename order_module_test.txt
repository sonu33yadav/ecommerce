There is "orders" table in the database.
Here, the user_id is the customer id so it is the id of "users" table.
the product_id is the product id so it is the id of the "products" table.
Order_number is the auto created number when the ordering is created.(Random 10 string or numbers)
Order_date is the date when the ordering is created.
Referral_code is the code when the customer used when ordering so it can be null.
status is Order status. So it can be "ordered". "refunded","cancelled" and so on.

To test this in the admin backend, you can write 5 or 6 records manually to this table.
Because this order is created when the customer orders the product so I think it should be done in the stage2 in the checkout&shopping.
